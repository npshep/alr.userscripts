A Little Tweak Test Suite
=========================

This directory contains Jasmine unit tests for each collection of userscripts.
To execute the tests:

1. Install the Jasmine from https://jasmine.github.io
2. Make a link 'jasmine' in the current directory that points to your Jasmine
   installation.
3. If necessary, update the Jasmine version in each of *.tests.html.
4. Open *.tests.html in a web brower.

- ideally, tests would run against a real version of the target web site, to
  detect changes in the application that require changes to the userscripts
