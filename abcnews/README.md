A Little ABC News
=================

This userscript streamlines the Australian Broadcasting Corporations's News
web site, https://www.abc.net.au/news, by removing unwanted sections and
hiding little-used sections. The appearance of each section can be configured
by the siteConf structure at the top of streamline.js.

The ABC is free to change its site at any time in such a way that this script
may no longer work.
