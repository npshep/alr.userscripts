A Little Tweak
==============

This repository contains a collection of userscripts that I developed for
disabling or streamlining features that I find useless or annoying in various
web sites. From user forums, I gather many other people find them useless or
annoying as well.

To use these scripts, you'll need to install a user script manager like
Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net) or
Violentmonkey (https://violentmonkey.github.io).

Each sub-folder contains userscripts for a single web site as described below.
Each script may be used by itself or in combination with others, though not
all combinations make sense.
- `abcnews`: The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's news web site,
   https://www.abc.net.au/news
- `office365`: Microsoft Office 365, https://www.office365.com

See the README file in each sub-folder for a detailed description of the
available tweaks. See the top of each userscript for configuration options
and read further down the script if you want to see how it works.

**I am in no way affiliated with the original developers of these sites and
the original developers are free to change their sites at any time in such a
way that these tweaks no longer work.**
